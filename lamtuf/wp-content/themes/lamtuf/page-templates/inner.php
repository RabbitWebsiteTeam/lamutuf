                    <p>These laminates are produced by impregnating cotton fabric with Phenolic resin and then pressing these prepegs under high pressure and controlled temperature. By choosing different grades (coarse/ medium/ fine wave) of Fabric and modifying phenolic resin, laminates of various grades and specifications are produced. If required, lubricants are added in the resin system to achieve better wear resistance. Cotton fabrics are scoured or bleached to improve electrical insulation and water resistance properties along with superior surface finish of the machined component.

These materials find numerous usages in mechanical applications like gears, pulleys, guides etc. and as bearing materials. These are also used where electrical insulation is required with structural / mechanical strengths.</p>

                    <p>These laminates are produced by treating beech wood veneers with Phenolic resin and then pressed under controlled pressure and temperature. By orienting veneers in cross or longitudinal manner products for specific applications are produced.

These products have excellent electrical insulating property, thermal insulation and good insulation in oil immersed applications in Transformers. Densified wood can withstand high mechanical load varying in temperatures. Special high density wood can be used for soft tool application for manufacture of Aircraft parts</p>

                  <p>These laminates are manufactured by treating E-Class glass fabric with electrical grade epoxy resin and then pressing these prepegs under high temperature and controlled pressure. Laminates are produced in grades to work upto 130Deg C,155Deg C and 180Deg C. Flame retardant grade is produced by modifying resin system 

These products have mechanical strength at elevated temperature, very good stabiluty of electrical properties under high humidity in mechanical, electrical and electronic applications. Can be used at cryogens temperature and have very good resistance to chemicals.</p>
